Getting Started
===============

There are two main types of objects in Traccess: data objects and computer
objects. Data objects hold specific types of information and data, such as the
:py:class:`~traccess.data.Demographic` which holds information on various populations. Computer
objects use these data sets to compute metrics of access
(:py:class:`~traccess.access.AccessComputer`) and equity (:py:class:`~traccess.access.EquityComputer`).
