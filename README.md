# Traccess
Transportation access and equity computations.

Traccess offers a set of fast and convenient functions to calculate multiple
transport accessibility measures. Given a pre-computed travel cost matrix, and
using data sets on land use supply, demand, and demographics, the package
computes accessibility levels using multiple accessibility measures, such as:
cumulative opportunities, minimum travel cost to closest *n* number of activities,
gravity-based (with different decay functions) and different floating catchment
area methods.

The package also contains a number of different methods for computing
distributive and sufficientarian equity measures to compare the level of access
provided across demographic groups.
